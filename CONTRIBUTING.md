# Contributing

Acsys has an active and growing open-source community.
All work on the open-source framework occurs in the GitHub organization.

## Governance

The Acsys project governance model follows the spirit and tradition of open-source
by embracing consensus, forking, and individual ownership.

### Principles

Acsys is an open, inclusive, and tolerant community of people working together
to build a world-class Node.js framework and tools. We value diversity of individuals and
opinions, and seek to operate on consensus whenever possible.
We strive to maintain a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free environment,
regardless of the form of communication. When consensus is not achievable, we defer
to the owners of each individual module; the powers of the individual owner are kept
in check by the ability of the community to fork and replace dependencies on the
individual module and maintainer.

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute to the Acsys project.
All contributions are welcome!

### Submitting a pull request

1. Create a GitHub issue for large changes and discuss the change there before coding.
   You can skip this step and submit the pull request for minor changes.
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Create a branch for your change/feature off of the master branch.
4. Make your change. For bugs, adding a failing test and
   submitting a pull request usually leads to the bug being fixed quickly.
   For features, include tests that cover the entire feature.
5. Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
6. Make commits of logical units and push them to Github.
7. Use a descriptive commit message.
8. Use GitHub's pull requests to submit the patch. Feel free to issue the pull
   request as soon as you have something partial to show and get reviewed.
   You can add more commits to your pull request as you are progressing on the implementation.
   The title of the pull request should start with "WIP" for "work in progress"
   when the pull request is not complete yet.
9. Request a code review. Add a specific committer to speed up this process.
10. Make any requested changes and push to your fork. Make sure your changes are still based
    on the latest code (use `git rebase upstream/master`).

### Reporting issues

Follow this basic process:

- Search existing issues. It's possible someone has already reported the same problem.
- Make sure you have a GitHub account.
- Create a new issue for the bug. Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce.
  Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
